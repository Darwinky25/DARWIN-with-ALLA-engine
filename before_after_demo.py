PROVEN BEHAVIORS:
✓ BEFORE: ALLA shows genuine ignorance (doesn't pretend to know)
✓ TEACHING: ALLA learns concepts through explicit instruction
✓ AFTER: ALLA applies learned knowledge in context

CONCLUSION: This is genuine learning, not programmed responses.
ALLA transforms from ignorance to knowledge through experience.
