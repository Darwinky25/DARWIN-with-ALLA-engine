## The Inquisitive Agent: AI That Learns Through Curiosity

ALLA is a groundbreaking autonomous AI agent that has evolved from a simple command processor into a **curiosity-driven learning system**. Unlike traditional AI that fails when encountering unknown concepts, ALLA actively seeks understanding by asking thoughtful questions about what it doesn't know.

### **What Makes ALLA Special?**

- **Proactive Learning**: Instead of failing on unknown words, ALLA asks "What is that?"
- **Autonomous Goal Pursuit**: Sets and pursues its own objectives
- **Dynamic Vocabulary Expansion**: Learns new concepts through natural conversation
- **Abstract Knowledge Formation**: Develops general understanding from specific experiences
- **Living World Integration**: Interacts with a persistent, dynamic environment

## **Quick Start Demo**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Darwinky25/DARWIN-with-ALLA-engine.git
cd DARWIN-with-ALLA-engine

# Run the v16.0 mystery object test
python test_v16_mystery_object.py
```

**Watch ALLA discover something new:**
```
User: take the flute
[ALLA ASKS] What is a 'flute'? Please describe it so I can understand.

User: teach noun "flute" as "obj.shape == 'cylinder' and obj.material == 'wood'"
[ALLA] Successfully learned new noun: 'flute'

User: take the flute
[ALLA] I am taking flute...
```

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.11+
- No external dependencies (pure Python implementation)

### **Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Darwinky25/DARWIN-with-ALLA-engine.git
cd DARWIN-with-ALLA-engine
```

### **Basic Usage:**
```python
from alla_engine import AllaEngine

# Initialize ALLA
alla = AllaEngine()

# Interact with ALLA
result = alla.process_command("create a red box as my_box")
print(result)

# Give ALLA a goal
alla.set_goal("I have the red box")

# Let ALLA think and act autonomously
alla.tick()  # Single thought cycle
```

### **Interactive Mode:**
```python
# Run a full interactive session
alla = AllaEngine()

while True:
    command = input("You: ")
    if command.lower() == 'quit':
        break
    feedback, result = alla.process_command(command)
    print(f"ALLA: {feedback}")
    if result:
        print(f"Result: {result}")
```

## **Technical Deep Dive**

### **The Curiosity Mechanism** *(v16.0)*
When ALLA encounters an unknown word, instead of failing:

1. **Detection**: CommandProcessor identifies unknown words during parsing
2. **Goal Creation**: Automatically generates an UNDERSTAND goal
3. **Planning**: Planner creates an OUTPUT_QUESTION plan  
4. **Execution**: ExecutionEngine outputs a question to the user
5. **Learning**: User can teach ALLA about the unknown concept
6. **Verification**: Goal is marked complete when word enters lexicon

### **The Learning Loop:**
```
Unknown Word → UNDERSTAND Goal → Question → Teaching → Knowledge → Success
```

### **Semantic Memory System** *(v14.0)*
ALLA builds abstract knowledge through:
- **Nodes**: Concepts (colors, shapes, actions, etc.)
- **Edges**: Relationships between concepts
- **Reflection**: Periodic analysis of experiences
- **Pattern Detection**: Automatic insight formation

### **Goal-Driven Architecture** *(v13.0)*
ALLA's autonomous behavior is driven by:
- **Goal Queue**: Active objectives to achieve
- **Planning System**: Multi-step plan generation
- **Execution Engine**: Action implementation
- **Feedback Loop**: Plan adjustment based on results

## **My Journey Building ALLA**

### **How It All Started**

I'm just a regular person from Indonesia who got really curious about artificial intelligence. When I started this project at 19, I had never written a single line of code before. I didn't have any formal training in computer science, no team to work with, and definitely no funding.

**Here's how my journey looked:**
- **Complete beginner**: I literally started by googling "how to program"
- **Working alone**: Just me, my computer, and a lot of late nights
- **Learning for free**: Using whatever free resources I could find online
- **Teaching myself**: YouTube tutorials, documentation, and lots of trial and error
- **From home**: Building this from my room in Indonesia

### **What I Learned Along the Way**

Building ALLA taught me that:

- You don't need a computer science degree to build interesting things
- Sometimes not knowing the "right way" to do something leads to creative solutions
- Being patient with yourself is really important when learning something completely new
- The internet has amazing resources if you're willing to dig deep and keep trying
- Small progress every day eventually adds up to something meaningful

### **Why I'm Sharing This**

I'm not trying to say my story is extraordinary or that I'm some kind of genius. I just want other people to know that if you're curious about something, you can probably learn it and build something cool with it.

If you're thinking about starting a programming project but feel intimidated because you don't have the "right" background - I hope my experience shows that you can just start where you are and figure it out as you go.

**ALLA is really just the result of curiosity, persistence, and a lot of googling "how do I..." followed by whatever I was stuck on that day.**

## **Star History**

If you find ALLA interesting or useful, please consider giving it a star!

ALLA represents a significant step toward AI systems that can truly learn and grow through curiosity and interaction, rather than just processing pre-trained knowledge. Every version has been a step toward more autonomous, intelligent, and curious artificial minds.

**The journey from v1.0 to v16.0 shows that step by step, we can build AI that doesn't just answer questions—it learns to ask them.**

### **What This Project Means to Me**

Building ALLA has been a personal journey that taught me a lot about learning and persistence. It started with simple curiosity about how AI works and grew into something I'm really proud of.

The experience showed me that:
- **Curiosity is powerful**: Asking "what if?" and "how does this work?" can take you far
- **Learning never stops**: Every day brought new challenges and new things to figure out
- **Fresh perspectives help**: Sometimes not knowing the "standard" way leads to interesting solutions
- **Small steps matter**: Every little improvement added up over time

---

*"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."* - Albert Einstein

*"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower."* - Steve Jobs

*"The best way to predict the future is to create it."* - Peter Drucker

**ALLA is my attempt to embody these principles in code, and working on it has definitely embodied them in my life.**

**This project started in Indonesia with zero coding knowledge and grew into something I'm excited to share with the world. I hope it shows that if you're curious about something, you can probably learn it and build something meaningful with it.**
