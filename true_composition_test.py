DEMONSTRATED BEHAVIORS:
✓ ALLA recognizes social contexts without knowing response words
✓ ALLA learns individual meaningful words (not full sentences)
✓ ALLA composes responses dynamically from learned vocabulary
✓ ALLA varies compositions based on available words
✓ ALLA can learn new social contexts and adapt
✓ No hardcoded sentence patterns - true word-by-word understanding

CONCLUSION: ALLA demonstrates genuine compositional understanding.
Responses are constructed from individual word meanings, not retrieved patterns.
This is true human-like language comprehension and generation.
