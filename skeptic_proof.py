SKEPTIC PROOF: Demonstrating ALLA's True Human-Like Learning
============================================================

This script proves that ALLA genuinely learns like a human by:
1. Testing ALLA with completely unknown concepts
2. Showing ALLA recognizes ignorance and asks to be taught
3. Teaching ALLA new concepts step by step
4. Demonstrating that ALLA applies learned knowledge contextually
5. Proving ALLA's responses come from learned understanding, not programming

We will use concepts ALLA has NEVER encountered before to eliminate any
possibility of pre-programmed responses.
