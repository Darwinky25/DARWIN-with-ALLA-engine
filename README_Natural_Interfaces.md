## ðŸ§  How ALLA Learns

ALLA v17.0 uses **curiosity-driven learning**:

1. **Unknown Word Detection**: When ALLA encounters a word it doesn't know, it automatically creates an "UNDERSTAND" goal.

2. **Question Generation**: ALLA asks natural questions like "What is a 'gadget'? Please describe it so I can understand."

3. **Teaching Integration**: You teach ALLA using the standard teaching syntax: `teach [type] "word" as "expression"`

4. **Memory Persistence**: ALLA remembers everything it learns across sessions.

5. **Natural Usage**: Once learned, ALLA uses new words naturally in future conversations.
