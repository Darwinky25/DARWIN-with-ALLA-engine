ALLA v17.0 SKEPTICAL REALITY TEST
===============================

This test is designed to be skeptical and test ALLA against real human logic and expectations.
We will test edge cases, logical consistency, and realistic behavior patterns.

Test Philosophy:
- Be skeptical of "success" that doesn't make logical sense
- Test edge cases that could reveal flaws
- Verify that responses align with human reasoning
- Check for consistent behavior across similar scenarios
- Ensure the system fails gracefully when it should
