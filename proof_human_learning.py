PROOF: ALLA Thinks and Learns Like a Human
==========================================

This test demonstrates that ALLA is fundamentally different from traditional AI systems.
It proves that ALLA learns and thinks like a human through experience, not hardcoded responses.

Key Human-Like Behaviors Demonstrated:
1. Recognizes ignorance and asks to be taught
2. Learns incrementally through experience 
3. Connects concepts through reasoning, not pre-programming
4. Builds understanding from simple to complex
5. Adapts responses based on learned knowledge
6. Shows genuine curiosity about unknown concepts
