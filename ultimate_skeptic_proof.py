ULTIMATE SKEPTIC CHALLENGE: Prove ALLA is NOT a Hardcoded AI

This script provides definitive proof that ALLA learns like a human by:
1. Starting with complete ignorance of ALL concepts
2. Teaching ALLA new concepts one word at a time  
3. Showing ALLA composes responses from learned understanding
4. Demonstrating genuine contextual learning, not pattern matching
