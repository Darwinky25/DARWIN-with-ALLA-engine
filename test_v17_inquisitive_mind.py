"""
ALLA v17.0 - THE INQUISITIVE MIND
=================================

This test demonstrates the revolutionary upgrade where ALLA becomes proactive about learning.
When encountering unknown words, instead of failing, ALLA creates UNDERSTAND goals and
autonomously asks the user for definitions.

Key Features Tested:
1. Unknown word detection triggers learning goals
2. Autonomous question generation
3. Goal-driven inquiry behavior
4. Integration with existing teaching system
5. Persistence across thinking cycles

Test Scenario: "The Mystery Harp"
- A world contains an object ALLA has never seen before
- User tries to interact with it using unknown vocabulary
- ALLA proactively asks for definitions
- User teaches ALLA the new concepts
- ALLA successfully completes the original task
