ALLA v18.0 PROFESSIONAL UPGRADE DEMONSTRATION
=============================================

This demonstration showcases the revolutionary improvements in ALLA v18.0:

🔧 PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECTURE FEATURES:
- Lark Grammar-Based Parsing (replaces 500+ line if/elif chain)
- Neo4j Graph Database Memory (with intelligent fallback)
- NetworkX Planning Algorithms (replaces hand-coded logic)
- Zero Regressions (all v17.0 features maintained)

🎯 BENEFITS DEMONSTRATED:
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Faster and more accurate parsing
- Scalable knowledge representation
- Intelligent planning capabilities
- Professional development practices
