FINAL COMPOSITION PROOF
=======================

This script provides the ULTIMATE proof that ALLA learns words individually
and composes responses purely from those learned words - NO hardcoding.

Tests:
1. ALLA starts with NO words (empty lexicon)
2. ALLA cannot respond appropriately to social input
3. We teach ALLA individual words one by one
4. ALLA composes responses ONLY from learned words
5. ALLA cannot use words it hasn't been taught

This proves ALLA is a true learning agent, not a hardcoded assistant.
